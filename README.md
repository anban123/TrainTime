In this assignment I created a train schedule simulator.

Below are the instructions:

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
-Train Name
-Destination 
-First Train Time -- in military time
-Frequency -- in minutes
-Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
-Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
-Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
